        <p>When there is an extra month in the Telugu calendar, two Brahmotsavam are held viz., Salakatla and Navarathri. Both festivals were held in 2015, 2018, 2020 and 2023

            Brahmotsavam 2024
            This year, in 2024, since there is no Adhika Maasa, there will only be one Brahmotsavam, which is the annual Salakatla Brahmotsavam.
            The Salakatla Brahmotsavam and the Navaratri Brahmotsavam will be held together..
            The TTD Brahmotsavam 2024 will take place from October 3 to October 12.[7]
            In Salakatla Brahmotsavam, Rathotsavam (Big Chariot) is held on the morning of the eighth day; during Navaratri Brahmotsavam, Golden Chariot (Swarna Rathotsavam) is held that morning of the eighth day. 
            In Salakatla Brahmotsavam, there will be flag hoisting (Dwajarohanam) on 1st day and flag-lowering (Dwajaavarohanam) on the evening of the ninth day.</p>
            <p>The Brahmotsavam is held over nine days at the beginning of the Hindu calendar month of Āśvina, paralleling Navaratri. The evening before the first day, the rite of Ankurarpana (the sowing of seeds to signify fertility and abundance) is performed. The main first-day activity is Dwajarohana, the raising of the Garuda flag to signify the beginning of the festival. Religious activities during the festival include daily homas and processions on streets surrounding the temple. The final day commemorates Venkateswara's birth star. The Sudarshana Chakra is bathed in the temple tank with the devotees. The Chakra is then placed on a high platform, and the devotees walk under it and are blessed with its dripping water. The festival ends with Dhvajavarohanam, the lowering of the Garuda flag.
               Dwajarohanam
                A ceremony on the first day, when a flag with a picture of Garuda (the vehicle of Vishnu) is hoisted over the temple.[11] The flag is believed to be a symbolic invitation to the Hindu deities to attend the festival.[11] After the ceremony, the Andhra Pradesh chief minister offers new silk clothes to Venkateswara</p>
